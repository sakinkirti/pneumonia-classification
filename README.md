### Summary of algorithm: <br>
This is a simple 4-layer NN that uses a linear forward prop step with ReLU activation functions for each hidden layer and a sigmoid activation function for the output layer. This allows for a highly accurate binary classification algorithm that allows the user to distinguish between pneumonia and normal X-rays

Accuracy on test set: 99.99999998% - Overfitting is a possibility 

- next step is to better tune the hyperparamters
